shoe
====

A simple little script to convert Local Shared Objects to json then back again for easy editing. Licensed under GPLv3.

Requires [PyAMF](http://www.pyamf.org/) >= 6.1 and [Python](https://www.python.org/)Python >= 2.7.

Just throw it somewhere like /bin/, /usr/bin/ or /usr/local/bin. What ever you like. Maybe change the name to just "shoe" for prettiness.

I made it as a way to cheat at flash games. So, don't expect much from it, it's just a shoe.
