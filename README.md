shoe
====

A simple little script to convert Local Shared Objects to json then back again for easy editing. Licensed under GPLv3.

Requires PyAMF and Python >= 2.6.

Just throw it somewhere like /bin/, /usr/bin/ or /usr/local/bin. What ever you like. Maybe change the name to just "shoe" for prettiness.

I made it as a way to cheat at a flash game. So, don't expect much from it, it's just a shoe.
